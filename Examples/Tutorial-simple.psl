notes

Things we hoped you to learn:
* Every chord must be written on a new line. 
* The chord format is: (newline)
lefthand;righthand;chordname;offsetx or ~(write on new line)
* There are several ways of writing down the pitch. look in the Tutorial for more info.
* In the last entry you can offset the x position or you can print it to the next line.
* When two chords are written against each other they are in the same measure.
* The title, composer and copyright headers are on top of the file, seperated by backslashes.
