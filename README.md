# PianoScript Diagram
PianoScript is a visual music notation designed for the piano keyboard. Before PianoScript I created this piano-keyboard-diagram(the pianoversion of the guitar-fretboard-diagram). The program is in a lilypond-like form, you type text on the left and get output on the right. With this program you can vreate simple leadsheets. It's my first program ever so it's kind of basic and not finished yet. things to do:
* If file is not changed don't ask to save yesno
* add exporting the page in pdf format(right now you can print the page, it wil output a test.ps which you can print)
* add printing the page

Please let me know what you think of the diagram. Use the 'info' menu option to open a small tutorial.
