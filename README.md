# PianoScript Diagram

PianoScript is a visual music notation designed for the piano keyboard. In my study period, I had big problems with reading traditional-notation. Therefore I started thinking and searching for a solution because I wanted to be able to learn a piece of music from a graphical notation. 

Then I found 'Klavarskribo', a music notation which the current PianoScript is based on. Klavarkribo is a beautiful piece of work by Cornelis Pot. He created probably the first midi recorder, must be around 1920(couldn't find the detailed info) for a piano. It consisted of a mechanic system that stamped the notes on a paper-roll while playing so you could record an improvisation and read it back. Later on he created his version of a piano-keyboard-notation called 'Klavarskribo'.

I used klavarskribo for several years but it didn't fully solve my problem. Because techniques of printing where different from now, certain elements have a solution which is visually unclear or 'just clear enough'. For example when a pianopiece has cross-hands in it or how the noteheads are clashing with the rhythmic notation. In his time Cornelis was only able to use black ink. But today we can use grey too and print way more detailed, the ink won't 'spread' over the paper. I decided in 2018 to start redesigning this system and gave it the name PianoScript because it is a script/one-way notation for piano. The target audience are piano players.

At a good day, while drawing and puzzling, I drawed my first piano-keyboard-diagram. It is the pianoversion of the guitar-fretboard-diagram. In fact a piano-diagram is an isolated element of klavarskribo. The Diagram shows you exactly which keys to press on the keyboard.
