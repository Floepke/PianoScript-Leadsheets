# PianoScript Diagram
PianoScript is a visual music notation designed for the piano keyboard. Before PianoScript I created this piano-keyboard-diagram(the pianoversion of the guitar-fretboard-diagram). The program is in a lilypond-like form, you type text on the left and get output on the right. With this program you can vreate simple leadsheets. It's my first program ever so it's kind of basic and not finished yet.
Please let me know what you think of the diagram. Use the 'info' menu option to open a small tutorial.
